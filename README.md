# ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Easy

[中文说明 / Chinese documentation](README_CN.md)

`ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Easy` provides a compact MiniMax H3 workflow surface for
text-to-video, image-to-video, first/last-frame generation, and full-reference
video generation in ComfyUI.

The main node keeps one multi-link `Media` port instead of exposing a fixed
row of image, video, and audio inputs. It also includes an `@` reference
editor, structured dialogue blocks, a literal raw-prompt view, external text
input support, mode-aware Prompt Guides, and optional API-based prompt
optimization.

The sampler, LoRA and attention patches, decoding, video assembly, and save
nodes remain outside the main node so the workflow continues to work with the
rest of the ComfyUI ecosystem.

## Highlights

### One multi-link `Media` input

Images, videos, and standalone audio clips connect to the same visible
`Media` port. Multiple links can enter that port at once.

- Images, videos, and audio are numbered independently.
- Each media type has its own wire color and preview treatment.
- Link order is retained when the workflow is saved and loaded.
- Dragging left from `Media` to empty canvas opens a quick-create menu for
  compatible media loader nodes.
- Clicking the number on a virtual media wire opens its delete menu.

</p>

The visible single port is intentional. The frontend transports the ordered
links through hidden execution inputs without turning the node back into a
large set of fixed sockets.

### `@` media references

In **Reference Video** mode, type `@` to select a connected image, video, or
standalone audio resource. The picker shows images first, videos second, and
audio last, with available previews.

</p>

</p>

References can be displayed by index or filename. At execution time they are
converted to MiniMax H3 tags such as `<Picture N>`, `<Video N>`, and
`<Audio N>`.

Video soundtracks remain paired with their source video. Standalone audio is
numbered separately. When the relationship would otherwise be ambiguous, the
node adds the video/audio provenance to the runtime prompt.

A disconnected `@` reference remains visible instead of being silently
deleted, and a mismatch between the number of references and connected media
does not block workflow execution. Reconnecting or removing stale references
is the user's responsibility.

### Dialogue blocks and raw prompt view

Type `#` in the structured editor to create a dialogue block.

  <img src="images/dialogue-block-en.png" alt="Dialogue block" width="560">
</p>

- `Enter` exits the dialogue block.
- `Shift+Enter` inserts a line break inside it.
- The block is serialized as `<d>...</d>`.
- Dialogue and lyric language is preserved; it is not forced to Chinese.

Use the `@` / `</>` button in the lower-right corner to switch between the
structured editor and the literal raw prompt. Raw mode displays the actual
`<Picture N>`, `<Video N>`, `<Audio N>`, and `<d>...</d>` text without
rendering chips or dialogue blocks.

### Native text input behavior

The prompt widget can be converted to an input and connected to a normal
ComfyUI `STRING` node. While an external text link is connected:

- the custom editor becomes read-only;
- the linked string is used as the prompt;
- internal editor text is not appended to it;
- prompt optimization is disabled for that editor.

`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` synchronizes the editor and allows ComfyUI's normal workflow
save shortcut to run. Native typing, Backspace, undo/redo, and canvas zoom
behavior remain available.

## Prompt optimization

Click the `✦` button in the prompt editor to rewrite the current prompt with a
configured API. During the request, the editor shows an activity indicator and
elapsed time.

The optimizer supports:

- OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions APIs;
- OpenAI Responses APIs;
- Gemini Native `generateContent` APIs;
- configurable API URL, API key, and model name;
- mode-aware MiniMax H3 Prompt Guides;
- optional reading of connected media;
- a 600-second request timeout;
- a requested maximum output of 50,000 tokens.

The actual output limit is still controlled by the selected model and API
provider. Providers with a lower limit may truncate the response or reject the
requested value.

### API settings popup

Enable **Advanced options**, then set **Optimizer settings** to `true`. This
temporarily opens the settings popup and automatically returns to `false` when
the popup closes.

The popup contains:

- API format: OpenAI Compatible, OpenAI Responses, or Gemini Native;
- API URL;
- API Key;
- model name;
- Read connected media.

These settings are stored in:

```text
ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Easy/prompt_optimizer.json
```

The file is shared by every MiniMax H3 Easy main node in that ComfyUI
installation and is excluded by `.gitignore`. The API Key input is visually
masked, but the JSON file itself contains the key in plain text. Do not publish
or package that file.

The selected **Prompt Guide** remains an ordinary per-node parameter and is
saved with the workflow.

### Prompt Guide selection

The optimizer always loads the general H3 rules, then selects the correct mode
guide:

- I2V / First/Last Frame mode uses the base T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, and L2VA guide.
- Reference Video mode uses the full-reference Ref2VA guide.
- The selected scene guide and its reference files are appended when present.

Included scene guides currently cover 3D animation shorts, brand promos,
co-op game intros, hand-drawn/live-action fusion, minimalist product ads,
music-video subtitles, paper collage, and papercraft stop motion.

### Connected media and evidence rules

When **Read connected media** is enabled, locally resolvable files up to 32 MiB
each may be attached to the optimization request:

- Gemini Native can receive image, video, and audio inline parts.
- OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions and OpenAI Responses requests currently attach images only.
- Unsupported, missing, or oversized files are skipped.

The system prompt explicitly tells the optimizer not to invent media content.
If no file is attached, or the selected model cannot perceive the supplied
modality, it must preserve relevant tags and reason only from the user's text
and explicit instructions.

### Re-optimization

If the current editor text is exactly the previous optimizer result, clicking
`✦` again regenerates from the original source prompt rather than repeatedly
rewriting the generated result. Once the result is manually edited, the edited
text becomes the next source prompt.

## Nodes

### MiniMax H3 Easy Loader

The bundled loader selects:

- FL2VA transformer;
- Ref2VA transformer;
- Qwen3-VL text encoder;
- video VAE;
- audio VAE.

One transformer may be set to `None`. The remaining transformer then serves
all modes. When both filenames are configured, FL2VA is preferred for text,
image, and keyframe generation, while Ref2VA is preferred for full-reference
generation.

Transformer files are loaded on demand. When the requested mode changes to a
different transformer file, the loader releases its cached transformer and
asks ComfyUI to empty the soft cache before loading the other one.

The filename matcher recognizes common community naming and quantization
variants, including `.safetensors` and `.gguf` releases.

### MiniMax H3 Easy Model Bridge

The Model Bridge assembles ordinary ComfyUI loader outputs into an H3 bundle.
It accepts:

- required `CLIP`, video `VAE`, and audio `VAE` inputs;
- optional FL2VA `MODEL`;
- optional Ref2VA `MODEL`;
- one or both transformer models.

This allows native, community, and GGUF loaders to be used instead of the
bundled loader. If upstream nodes load both transformer models, both may remain
resident according to ComfyUI's model-management behavior. Connect only one
transformer when minimizing memory use is more important than automatic
per-mode model selection.

### MiniMax H3 Easy

The main node handles prompt editing, media ordering, dimensions, duration,
mode selection, conditioning, and latent preparation. It outputs:

- `Model`: connect to a model-only LoRA, attention patch, accelerator, or
  sampler;
- `H3 Context`: connect to **MiniMax H3 Easy Output**.

### MiniMax H3 Easy Output

This node expands `H3 Context` into standard workflow outputs:

- Conditioning;
- Latent;
- Video VAE;
- Audio VAE;
- FPS.

## Modes and media limits

### I2V or First/Last Frame

- No media: text-to-video.
- One image: first-frame or last-frame generation, selected in Advanced.
- Two images: first/last-frame generation.
- Video and audio inputs are rejected in this mode.
- Maximum: two images.

### Reference Video

- Maximum: nine images, three videos, and three standalone audio clips.
- Maximum combined visible media links: fifteen.
- At least one image or video is required; audio-only reference mode is not
  accepted.
- Image, video, and audio numbering remains independent.

## Parameters

### Resolution and aspect ratio

Resolution presets use megapixel-style budgets:

`360P`, `416P`, `480P`, `540P`, `640P`, `720P`, `768P`, `832P`, `928P`,
`1024P`, `1080P`, and `Custom`.

Available aspect ratios are `1:1`, `2:3`, `3:2`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `9:16`,
`16:9`, and `21:9`. Preset dimensions and custom dimensions are aligned to
multiples of 32.

### Duration and FPS

- Duration: `0.2` to `60.0` seconds in `0.1`-second steps.
- FPS: `1` to `120`, available under Advanced options.
- Default FPS: `24`.

MiniMax H3 frame length is aligned to valid `5 + 17n` frame counts. The actual
frame count is therefore the nearest supported value rather than always being
exactly `seconds × FPS`. Very small duration/FPS combinations still produce at
least five frames.

### Advanced options

Advanced options are off by default and physically collapse unused rows. They
contain only controls relevant to the current mode:

- FPS;
- first-frame or last-frame priority;
- reference image sizing: match generation size, 1K/1.5K/2K pixel area,
  or original size;
- `@` display by index or filename;
- Optimizer settings popup switch;
- per-node Prompt Guide.

### Reference image sizing

Reference image resizing uses one uniform scale factor, so the image is not
stretched independently along the horizontal and vertical axes. The available
modes are:

- **Match generation size**: scales each reference image toward the current
  video generation pixel area, following the official H3 reference pipeline.
- **1K area**: approximately `1 MP` (`1024 x 1024` equivalent).
- **1.5K area**: approximately `2.25 MP` (`1536 x 1536` equivalent).
- **2K area**: approximately `4 MP` (`2048 x 2048` equivalent).
- **Original**: sends the connected image to the reference VAE without image-
  side resizing. This can use substantially more memory with high-resolution
  or numerous references.

The area presets resize down only. H3-aligned dimensions are selected near the
target area while prioritizing the source aspect ratio; reference images are
not cropped. The setting affects reference-image conditioning only and does
not change the video's generation width, height, resolution preset, duration,
or FPS.

## Installation

Install the repository as:

```text
ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Easy
```

Restart ComfyUI after installing or updating Python files. A browser refresh is
normally sufficient for frontend-only changes.

Place models in the standard folders:

```text
ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/
ComfyUI/models/text_encoders/
ComfyUI/models/vae/
```

For `.gguf` transformer or text-encoder files, install
[ComfyUI-GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF) and restart ComfyUI.
Regular safetensors files continue to use native ComfyUI loaders.

Example workflows are available in the [`workflow`](workflow) directory.

## Notes

- The node supports both the legacy ComfyUI canvas and Nodes 2.0.
- Chinese browsers show Chinese UI labels; other browsers show English labels.
- Workflow serialization preserves normal node parameters and editor content.
- Model-only LoRA and attention patches belong after the main node's `Model`
  output.
- Prompt optimization is an optional editing tool and is not required to run
  MiniMax H3 generation.
